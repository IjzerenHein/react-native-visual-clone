# Shared Element Transition Example

The example app serves as an exploration and testing tool. It features a custom stack router which implements the shared element primitives. It also implements the react-navigation binding and serves as a testing tool for that.

## Usage

```bash
# Installation
yarn # in the root directory
cd Example
yarn
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Run for ios
react-native run-ios

# Run for android
react-native run-android
```
