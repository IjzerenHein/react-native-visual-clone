# Unimodules

- What prefix to use for community packages?
- Create bare `example` project (use `link:../` in package.json & update pod)
- Universal infra for `findNodeHandle` & accessing views on native is missing (workaround is possible though)
- Native Animation.Value properties dont work (on iOS) (are not propagated to the native code)
- Call `lint ./example` to include example app

- CGFloat, NSInteger cannot be used by Unimodules (document?, throw warnings?)
