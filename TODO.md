Open issues:
[X] Strategy for animation-types (auto?)
[X] iOS clipping when content is entirely not visible
[ ] iOS border-radius clipping (parent clipping)
[ ] iOS Image Border-radius & contain test
[ ] iOS Compound view "fade" issue
[ ] iOS ImageBackground test sometimes fails
[ ] iOS View border tests regularly fail
[ ] iOS Compound components Fade test fails (target images are not loaded)
[X] Android RN-screens layout issues
[X] Android FastImage & FirebaseUI support
[X] Android `resize` prop support
[X] Android backgroundImage support
[X] Android scale transform support
[X] Android `debug` prop support (fix measurement event)
[ ] Android `align` prop support
[ ] Android FirebaseUI rounded corners
[ ] Android inverted scrollview clipping
[ ] Android image resizeMode mode & border-radius drawing artefact
[ ] Android elevation-shadow & clip artefact
[ ] Android clip doesn't work correctly when border-radius is used

Would be nice:
[ ] Show / hide animations
[ ] Show / hide animations on Shared Element renderer
[ ] Better image fade
[ ] Web support
[ ] Blur radius

Probably not:
[ ] react-native-photo-view
