# First impressions

We've all been there, we're looking for a package to solve a problem and arrive at its README.
Only to find that it's not really clear what this package solves and whether it serves your needs.
Perhaps there is a link to more documentation, or even better, a demo, but perhaps not.

Time is a precious resource, for developers and for maintainers alike. Good documentation empowers
developers and allows maintainers to reach as many developers as possible. It saves both of them a lot of time.
And this journey all starts with the first impression and the question "what does this solve" and "is this right for me"?


The first part of the README should therefore be focused on 





- Time is precious
- First impressions can only be made once, make it count
- Communicate clearly what problem this package solves
-
